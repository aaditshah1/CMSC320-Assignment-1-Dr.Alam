chronic conditions, such as diabetes or heart disease. By analyzing patterns in patient data, healthcare 
providers can implement preventative measures or early interventions, potentially reducing 
hospitalizations and improving overall health outcomes.

Answer: Merge combines the changes from different branches into a single 
branch which helps in preserving the history of both brances whereas rebasing
moves commits from one branch onto another, which results in a linear and 
cleaner history but it alters the commit history.

Q4: What skills do you hope to improve during this course?

Answer: I hope to improve my skills in data analysis, data visualization,
and statistical modeling. I also will get to learn and be familiar with
important python libraries like Pandas and Numpy and learn more about 
machine learning techniques which will be very useful for me in my career.
